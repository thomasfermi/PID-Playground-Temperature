# PID-Playground-Temperature
This is an interactive web app to explore the P, I, and D terms of the PID controller in a simple example.

The web app shall be included in the [Algorithms for Automated Driving web book](https://thomasfermi.github.io/Algorithms-for-Automated-Driving/Introduction/intro.html) in the future.
